Hi this is my research results for the task given.
I have tried to do this using python script and open ai api but I was coming to the same end everytime which says that i hot a rate limit error and to rectify this i would need to get a subscription.
So I did it the traditional way by using chatgpt itself .
I used the clay website and got a list of companies providing the names and their services and exported them in the form of a csv file.
then I tried using the method mentioned in the given pdf and it was a deadend.
But i got the results and this was a new learning curve for me and thankyou for providing me with this task.
It would be fantastic if i got the role.
And I got pushed to learn about the tutorial and documentation on openai and langchain for doing this I am proud that I got this far in the span of 2 days and i know i can do better with a proper guidance , so consider me for this role you won't regret it.
